1 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

  The WaveNET Transfer Protocol (WTP) is an phisical through application level
  protocol for distributed, collaborative information systems.

  This specification defines the protocol referred to as "WTP/0.1". This
  protocol includes requirements to ensurereliable implementation of its
  features.

  Practical information systems require the ability to send and retrieve
  information.

1.2 Requirements

  - The system requires a RaspberryPi with the buzzer software (WaveNET trans-
  mitter protocols) installed as an transmitter device, said software uses
  Python 2.7.15 to run the buzzer.
  - The receiving devices require at least JAVA 7 installed and the receiver
  WaveNET protocols intalled.

1.3 Terminology

  This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played
  by participants in, and objects of, the WaveNET communication.

  buzzer
    WaveNET transmitter protocols.

  receiver
    Device connected to the WaveNET in which the receiver protocols are installed.
    Identified with a physical address.

  mac address
    A device's physical address.

  ip address
    A device's network address.

1.4 Overall Operation

  The WaveNET system is a communication system, similar to TCP/IP. A client connects
  to a network in order to transmit a message to a single or multiple receivers.

  The clients' addresses are stored in the transmitter device in a MySQL database,
  which makes device aware of the number and identity of the conneccted devices.

  Tthe transmission protocol uses an onion algorithm to send messages from one client
  to another.
